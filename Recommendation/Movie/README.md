Many streaming platform services (Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, youtube, etc.) try to learn your interests or habits and make recommendations on products and services according to it's interpretation of your tendencies. You are what you love and you love what you are. Algorithms simply refines that echo chamber to tickle your ego. Recommendation engines are under the umbrella of AI. Recommender system is one of the techniques in ML. In the context of movie recs, the engine predicts the rating a consumer might give to a movie. Then the machine ranks the movies according to how it thinks the consumer might like them. Relevancy to the consumer is key. The engine runs on filtering -- content or collaborative. Content filtering is based on other users who are similar to you demographically (age, gender, geogpraphy, etc.). Collaborative filtering is based on your recorded behaviors. It also extrapolates your profile by considering other users who share similar behaviors as you. The assumption is you and the other similar profiles probably have high likelihood of overlaps in movie tastes. Now I'd like to give this a try by pretending i'm Netflix.
